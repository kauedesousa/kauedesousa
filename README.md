### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Agricultural Scientist working as Associate Professor on Data-Driven Agriculture at the [Inland Norway University](https://www.inn.no/english/) and Associate Scientist at the System Transformation Group at [The Alliance of Bioversity and CIAT](https://alliancebioversityciat.org). In our group we perform multidisciplinary research incorporating methods from environmental, social, geographical and computer sciences to define transformation strategies in food systems at global and national levels. I am also WP leader of the 1000FARMS Platform where I focus in develop capacity among African NARS to independently design, implement and analyze large-N decentralized trials for breeding decisions.
