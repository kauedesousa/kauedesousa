### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an Agricultural Scientist working as Associate Professor on Data-Driven Agriculture at the [Inland Norway University](https://www.inn.no/english/) and Scientist for the System Transformation Group at [The Alliance of Bioversity and CIAT](https://alliancebioversityciat.org). In our group we perform multidisciplinary research incorporating methods from environmental, social, geographical and computer sciences to propose transformation strategies in food systems in the Global South. Currently my research focus is in East and West Africa where, in collaboration with CGIAR Centres and NARES, we are scaling a large-N on-farm trial network to support breeding decisions with CGIAR mandate crops. I am commited to open-source data (and workflows) and most of my code is published in our Team Page on [GitHub](https://github.com/AgrDataSci).
